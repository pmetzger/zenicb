1) Check the Makefile in this directory and make sure the settings are correct.

2) Run `make install'.

3) If you don't install ZenICB in the system directories you need to add
   an entry to your "load-path", preferably in your ~/.emacs file:


  (setq load-path
        (cons (expand-file-name "/full/path/to/zenicb/directory") load-path))

4) Read src/zenicb-example.el for instructions on how to set up ZenICB
   for daily abuse.

To try it out, run `emacs', M-x load-library zenicb, M-x zenicb, Waste Time.
If this doesn't work, mail your problems to `fn-zenicb@Hungry.COM',
or directly to me.
